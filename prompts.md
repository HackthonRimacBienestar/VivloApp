MASCOTA

3D illustration of a cute health companion robot mascot sitting in a relaxed, welcoming pose. The robot has a big rounded TV-like head with a glossy black screen face and soft glowing eyes and smile, giving a warm, caring expression. Its body is small and chubby with rounded arms and legs, designed to look friendly and non-threatening, like a toy. The overall shape language should be very rounded and soft, with no sharp edges. Use a main palette of vibrant insurance red and deep navy blue, with accents of soft teal and warm yellow light, matching a Peruvian health insurance app. On the robot’s chest, include a small raised heart emblem with a zigzag pulse line inside (similar to an ECG), echoing the app logo but simplified. Around the robot’s waist, add a floating donut-shaped ring in teal that suggests protection and continuous support, but keep it subtle so the character remains the focus. The robot raises one hand in a little wave and the other hand rests near a small glowing heart-shaped orb on the ground, symbolizing guidance and wellbeing for chronic patients (diabetes, hypertension). Render it in a high-quality 3D style with smooth gradients, soft subsurface lighting, gentle reflections and soft shadows. The character should feel modern, empathetic, trustworthy and slightly premium, suitable as the main avatar inside a wellbeing and chronic-care mobile app. Isolate the robot on a clean white or transparent background, square 1:1 aspect ratio, high resolution.
